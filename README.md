# Pokemon-Battle-System
Recreating the Pokemon Gen 1 battle system from scratch. First goal is to get a presentable MVP working before moving on.

# Reason for recreating this
This should help my students understand how a developer would approach a problem and take them all the way from pseudo coding to finalizing the project. I also find this very fun so it is a win win for me.
